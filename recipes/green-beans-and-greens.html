    <h4>A lighter, fresher, tangier, crunchier eggplant parmigiana.</h4>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 cup olive oil.</li>
        <li>3 large shallots, thinly sliced.</li>
        <li>Kosher salt, freshly ground black pepper.</li>
        <li>2 pounds green beans, trimmed.</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter.</li>
        <li>4 anchovy fillets.</li>
        <li>1 large bunch kale or Swiss chard, thick stems removed, leaves torn in to bite-size pieces.</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons apple cider, white wine vinegar, or fresh lemon juice, plus more for seasoning.</li>
        <li>Flaky sea salt.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Heat oil and shallots in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook, swirling the skillet occasionally, until shallots are lightly browned and starting to crisp, 5 to 6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer shallots to a paper towel; season with salt and pepper.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Transfer half of the oil from the pan to a small bowl. Return the skillet to medium-high heat, and add green beans. Season with salt and pepper and cook, without tossing, until lightly charred and blistered on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Give them a toss, and cook, another 3 to 4 minutes, until just tender and cooked through.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Add butter and anchovies, and season with salt and pepper. Add kale, and toss to coat until greens are wilted and tender and butter is melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat, and add vinegar, tossing to coat. Season with salt, pepper and more vinegar, if needed.</p></li>
        
        <li><p>Transfer to a large bowl or platter and drizzle with reserved shallot oil. Scatter with fried shallots and flaky salt, and serve.</p></li>
    </ol>
